SASS styles for customing [ant.design](https://ant.design/)

## ❓ Reasons

1. [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) cannot work with LESS (you should eject for LESS);
2. As option.

## 📦 Install

```
npm i https://github.com/hezymal/antd-sass --save-dev
```

## 🔨 Usage

1. After package installed, create and import SASS file, for example, `index.scss`;
2. Copy and paste there `components/style/color/colors.scss`;
3. Copy and paste there `components/style/themes/_default.scss`;
4. In end of file import `components/style/index`, after add all imports of use components;
5. Now, you can change any style in `index.scss`.

Same you can see example.
